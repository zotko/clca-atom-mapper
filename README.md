# CLCA Atom Mapper
The Canonical Labeling for Clique Approximation (CLCA) algorithm is an extended-connectivity atom mapping algorithm developed by [Kumar et al](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ci5003922). CLCA uses prime number factorisation to generate canonical labels for atoms.

This implementation is the result of my master's thesis at Goethe University Frankfurt. The thesis can be found [here](https://github.com/zotko/a-star-atom-mapper/blob/59b9af363c182970eff8b93f0e8c4a629756ba0b/master_thesis.pdf).
